A pharma delivery bot which will deliver medicines to the
particular location (household where medicine is ordered).

In the "Pharma Bot" theme, we attempt to address this issue by building autonomous delivery robots that "pick up" medicine packets from pharmacies and distribute them across our "Smart city" arena.

Learnings: Image Processing, Line following using Image Processing, Algorithm Building, Robotic Navigation and Localization, Robotic Simulation, Python and Lua programming.

Implementation: Simulator + Hardware based.

Goals
- Take a package from the Location on arena which is detected from the Top camera kept on ceiling .
- Emulate the following same in Vrep Robotic Simulator
- Scan the QR code kept at the Location and know the delivery points.
- Delivery the package to the Correct Location.
